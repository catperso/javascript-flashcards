            <div class="card-text">
              <p>JavaScript is a programming language used to make web pages interactive. Like HTML and CSS, you do not need to install anything to begin writing JavaScript or see it run on your users' computers. All modern browsers support JavaScript which means JavaScript that you write for your web pages will automatically run when your visitors load your web page in their browsers. In fact, JavaScript is the only scripting language that all browsers support so if you want a page to have dynamic content, learning JavaScript is a must.</p>

            <div class="card-text">
              <p>Operators are special characters that indicate an action to be performed. +, -, *, /, and % are a few operators that reperesent basic arithmetic.</p>

            <h2 class="card-title">Variables</h2>
            <div class="card-text">
              <p>Variables are one of the major features of computer programming and we will use them all the time. A variable is just a container that stores some information such as a number, an object, or a string. A variable can be declared with one of the following JavaScript reserved words: <strong>var</strong> is short for variable. This is the traditional way of declaring a variable but it has some longstanding issues so we won't use this option. <strong>let</strong> is a more modern way to declare a variable whose value will change. <strong>const</strong> is a more modern way to declare a variable whose value will never change.</p>

            <h2 class="card-title">Variable Naming Conventions</h2>
            <div class="card-text">
              <p>Variables are named with all the words in the name as one word, with every word after the first capitalized (example: myFavoriteNumber). This naming convention is called lower camel case because the lower and upper case letters look a little like the humps on a camel. (There are other camel case naming conventions such as upper camel case, too, which will learn about when they are needed.) With lower camel case, we always lowercase the first letter of the first word but then capitalize the first letter of any other word in the variable.</p>

            <h2 class="card-title">Functions</h2>
            <div class="card-text">
              <p>A function is a bundle of code that can be called upon to perform a set of procedures. Variables can be passed to functions via arguments and parameters so that the function can manipulate or modify them as needed.</p>

            <h2 class="card-title">Methods</h2>
            <div class="card-text">
              <p>A method is a function that is called on something to manipulate that element. A good example of this is the .toUpperCase() method, which can be called on a string to capitalize all the letters in it.</p>

            <h2 class="card-title">Arguments</h2>
            <div class="card-text">
              <p>An argument is the value that is passed into a parameter. Since we'll be working with variables a lot, we'll often pass variables into parameters as arguments. We can also pass other data types into parameters as well, but it's much more common to pass in variables.</p>

            <h2 class="card-title">Parameters</h2>
            <div class="card-text">
              <p>A parameter is a placeholder for an argument. We use parameters when we declare functions and methods. Arguments are passed through when the function is called, and the parameters used in the function refer to whatever arguments were passed.</p>

            <h2 class="card-title">Chaining Methods</h2>
            <div class="card-text">
              <p>Methods can be chained by appending additional method names to the prior methods. For example, you can use .concat().toUpperCase() on a string to add more letters onto the string, and then capitalize the entire thing.</p>

          <div class="card-body">
            <h2 class="card-title">Strings</h2>
            <div class="card-text">
              <p>Strings are one of the six different <strong>primitives</strong> in JavaScript. A string is a set of characters enclosed in quotations. "hello" is a string. So is "Good morning, everyone!!!" And, just to make things a little tricky, "21" is a string, not a number. That's because it's enclosed in quotations, and any set of characters - whether that's letters, numbers, nineteen exclamation points in a row, or some combination thereof - is a string. We will be using strings all of the time.</p>

            <h2 class="card-title">Booleans</h2>
            <div class="card-text">
              <p>Booleans are one of the six different <strong>primitives</strong> in JavaScript. A boolean can be one of two values: true or false. That's it. We will use these a lot, too, and we will cover these in detail in the next course section.</p>

            <h2 class="card-title">Undefined</h2>
            <div class="card-text">
              <p>Undefined is one of the six different <strong>primitives</strong> in JavaScript. Undefined: This is a fun one... or rather, most of the time it's not so fun when it shows up in our code. It just means something hasn't been defined yet. The reason it's often not so fun is because we'll see that something is undefined in our code when we don't want it to be. This means there's a bug we need to fix. Don't worry, we will get a lot of practice with undefined, whether we want to or not!</p>

          <div class="card-body">
            <h2 class="card-title">NaN</h2>
            <div class="card-text">
              <p>NaN stands for Not A Number. The value NaN is treated in JavaScript as a number, oddly enough, and it's what will be returned if you try to divide 0 by 0 (for example).</p>

            <div class="card-text">
              <p>Null is one of the six different <strong>primitives</strong> in JavaScript. Null just means nothing. We will sometimes want to assign a null value to a thing because we don't know what value it should have yet.</p>

            <div class="card-text">
              <p>jQuery is a JavaScript library that makes it easier to incorporate JavaScript on your web pages. When we say it is a library, we mean that many common tasks that would take many, many lines of JavaScript code to execute have been packaged into methods that you'll be able to use with a single line of code. These methods are always available and ready to use the same way you might check out a book at a library. The goal of jQuery is to allow its users to "write less, do more". It's also one of the primary ways we can add interactivity to our sites.</p>
